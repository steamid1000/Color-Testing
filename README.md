# Color-Testing
Simple program that draws circles on the position of the mouse click and then expands, causing some nice visuals ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜®

Note:
  # The dll files are in the "Library Files.rar" file extract them in the build folder after compiling the code in visual studio, boht debug as well as release
  dlls are present so extract according to which build you choose
  
  # Also the font works only when you lanch from the visual studio and not from the file explorer, this will be fixed soon
 
 Thank you.
